# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
For this analysis, I will use Python and Pandas to create a summary of Pyber ride-sharing data by city type (urban, suburban, rural). I will then restructure the data to create visuals using Matplotlib to show total weekly fares for each city type to identify differences to aid in making key decisions for Pyber. 

## Results
As you can see in the image below, there is a wide gap between the urban and rural data. In the urban area, it is clear that there is a higer number of total drivers, leading to a higher number of total rides. Additionally, we can see an inverse relationship for the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver as both of these data points are lower than the other city types.

## Summary (Business Recommendations) 
1. Add drivers to the suburban area (adding drivers to this city types will increase total rides, which will drive down average fare per ride and average fare per driver, but it will increase total fares overall which is beneficial for total company revenue)
2. Add drivers to the rural area (same reasoning as above)
3. Increase fare amount incrementally (this increase in average fare per ride will help increase average fare per driver. With drivers making more money, they will be incentivised to drive more hours, which in turn will bring in a higher total fare and higher total revenue for the company)
